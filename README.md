# New Year Counter

### Countdown to the New Year in Elixir

The NewYearCounter is a simple Elixir-based application designed to provide a countdown timer to the upcoming New Year. This project serves as a practical exploration of Elixir's capabilities, particularly focusing on handling date and time operations, and applying concurrent programming principles using the OTP framework.

### Key Features:

- **Real-time countdown:** Calculates the time left until the next New Year in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **UTC Time Zone:** Utilizes Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to ensure that the countdown is consistent regardless of the user's local time zone.
- **Concise Output:** The application outputs the remaining time to the console in a clear and simple format.

This project was developed as a part of my learning journey with Elixir. The application uses basic functions of Elixir and OTP (Open Telecom Platform) to demonstrate how to schedule tasks, manage application behavior, and interact with time data.
