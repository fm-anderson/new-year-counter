# NewYearCounter

## Countdown to the New Year in Elixir

The NewYearCounter is a simple Elixir-based application designed to provide a countdown timer to the upcoming New Year. This project serves as a practical exploration of Elixir's capabilities, particularly focusing on handling date and time operations, and applying concurrent programming principles using the OTP framework.
